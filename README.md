Algorithms implemented in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/).

## üèÅ What's This?

Welcome to `~/nilgorithms`. It's most likely that you've not heard of Nim-lang (if you have, please [jump in](#contributing)) and that you're interested to learn about this language.

Cool then grab a coffee :coffee: and...

- If you've very little programming experience go to: [Nim Basic](https://narimiran.github.io/nim-basics/)
- If you know other programming languages hop on to: [Nim for X programmers](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/wiki#nim-for-x-programmers)

## üõ† Contributing

- Please follow the [Nim Style Guide](https://nim-lang.org/docs/nep1.html/)
- Fork this repository and create a suitable branch
- If you're creating a folder name it in `snake_case`
- All file names are in `camelCase`
  - Algorithms with multiple implementation techniques goes as `algorithmName_method`
  
    ```bash
    # example
    nilgorithms
      |-- math
        |-- checkPrime_iterative
        |-- checkPrime_recursive
    ```

- Preferred intend size is 2 spaces (not 4 :wink:)
- File docstring

```nim
#[
  Problem: Describe your problem
